# pb-16S-nf_tutorial

Pacbio 16S data analysis using the pacbio **[pb-16S-nf](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pb-16S-nf)** nextflow pipeline 

The code should be installed from the original github.

The **[Zymo_pb-16S-nf.pdf](https://github.com/Nucleomics-VIB/pb-16S-nf_tutorial/blob/main/Zymo_pb-16S-nf.pdf)** document describes installing and running the pipeline on 5 samples produced in the lab and using v0.4 of the pipeline (commit:763d542c5c82adb6cff769e253ebc15f61d765cb). It rephrases most of the content of the original repo and comments on the used tools.

The results of running the pipeline on five of our Zymo samples are uploaded in (https://github.com/Nucleomics-VIB/pb-16S-nf_tutorial/tree/main/Zymo-SequelIIe-Hifi_results_local) for revew and explorations.

# Where to go next?

Please start by reading the full information present on teh source github repo.

The full list of ``pb-16S-nf nextflow`` commands for that pipeline can be obtained with the comamnd:
